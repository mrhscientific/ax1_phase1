# Comparison between AX-1 and reference codes (MCNP, Serpent, OpenMC)
#
# Note: This is a stub framework. Full implementation would:
#   1. Run reference codes (MCNP, Serpent, OpenMC)
#   2. Parse their output files
#   3. Compare key metrics (keff, flux, reaction rates)
#   4. Calculate differences and statistics
